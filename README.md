## Goal
This is my "20 minutes" script to be up and running on any ubuntu computer.  This is not meant to work with other envs as i don't care.

## Contribution
I have no problems with contributions for any glaring bugs, everything else, all other features / things i should definitely have, please don't.  Just annoying and noisy.  I don't like your setup, i like mine.

## How To Setup Env
1. Get ansible on your system asap.  I'll make this process easier and eventually will have dev.theprimeagen.com just emit out this little script so its simple to start with

Run this in the directory you wish to clone down theprimeagen dev

```
mkdir personal
cd personal
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ThePrimeagen/dev/master/setup | sh
```

## TODO

1. neovim
1. neovim-local-dev
1. core utils that i love
1. i3
1. tmux
1. tmux-sessionizer

## Done

1. Install docker and ensure user crap is done 
1. cp over keyboard config and layout into xkb

## Ponderings
Should I have languages be installed or just assume those are things i'll let myself figure out later.  Such as installing `n` and node or golang.  Rust is pretty easy because it self updates
