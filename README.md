## How To Setup Env
1. Get ansible on your system asap.  I'll make this process easier and eventually will have dev.theprimeagen.com just emit out this little script so its simple to start with

Run this in the directory you wish to clone down theprimeagen dev

```
mkdir personal
cd personal
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ThePrimeagen/dev/master/setup | sh
```

2. playbooks playbooks playbooks.  I got to figure the part out where i do a playbook pull from github.  I'll need to update my setup script to include a bunch of friendly links to make installing easy

## New Setup
I have decided to take the time and optimize around the concept of the 20 minute dev env.  I think that i should be able to setup any dev environment in under 20 minutes.

This will include:
- neovim
- docker
- golang
- rust
- common programs (jq, htop)
- keyboard remap

## Goals
- to not be a weeb and a furry
