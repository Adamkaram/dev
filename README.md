## New Setup
I have decided to take the time and optimize around the concept of the 20 minute dev env.  I think that i should be able to setup any dev environment in under 20 minutes.

This will include:
- neovim
- docker
- golang
- rust
- common programs (jq, htop)
- keyboard remap

## Goals
- to not be a weeb and a furry
